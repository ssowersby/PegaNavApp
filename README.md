This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## To Run Locally

`npm install && npm start`

### Note
I did not focus on stlying of page content for the purposes of this demo. I focused on creating a navigation component (MainNav) that is capable of taking in navigation options and create action options to render an interactive navigation menu. Those options are statically created inside of MainWrapper and passed as props, though the intention is that these values could come from any sort of store or configuration.
